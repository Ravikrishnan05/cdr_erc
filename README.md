my topic is power electronics
//procedure for documentation
what ever they have asked just copy paste it and start answer the the questons
//go to chapter 3 
//extract requirement from chapter 3
* You must address the following minimum requirements: [size, weight, E-STOP, communications, and safe carry]
* Example, when on power electronics node, replaceable batteries and kill switch can be listed under that node as requirements
(along with numerous other requirements of that subsystem ofc)
* Understanding of key requirements was done in erc. So we have a list of requirements ready.
How we decided on them is the question to be answered
|*| requirements -take reference from arc 
|*| verification
|*| validation
power requirement of power sources (24V, 12V, 5V) to which all the components are connected in parallel.
Parallel connections are chosen to ensure that in the event of one component's failure, the remaining connections continue to function normally.
  //write about which battery is used for what purposes
